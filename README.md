--------------------- ABOUT THE GAME LAUNCHER ------------------------  
With the games: brick breakers, tic-tac-toe, snake and tetris  
With the apps: calculator, stopwatch and text editor   
Themes, and hyperlinks
  
I called it Star Launcher and the application was developed in Java, which is a launcher for games and various applications also developed in Java.  
This project aimed at the Proof of Professional Aptitude.
  
---------------------- Where are the files ----------------------------  
Unfortunately, Launcher was developed in my mother tongue, Portuguese language, which will make it difficult to find the files.  
  
The games are in the "jogos" folder  
The apps are in the "apps" folder  
The images are in the "img" folder  
The themas are int the "img/temas" folder  
  
If you delete any image without deleting the code, the launcher will not run.
